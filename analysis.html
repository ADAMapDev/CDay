    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>The development of AIM provided the team with firsthand experience in designing and building a system grounded in accessibility, usability, and real-world relevance. From its earliest stages, the project was informed by the critical need to address campus navigation challenges faced by users with disabilities. This required not just thoughtful technical decisions, but also a deep understanding of inclusive design principles and user experience best practices.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One of the most valuable aspects of AIM was confronting and overcoming practical challenges. Integration with external APIs and fine-tuning the interface across different device types revealed the complexity of designing for diverse environments. The team's commitment to iterative improvement, including continuous versioning through GitHub and regular peer testing, ensured consistent progress and rapid troubleshooting.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Importantly, AIM highlighted how accessibility is not an optional layer to be added after functionality—it is a core design requirement from the outset. Every feature added to the system had to be balanced against clarity, simplicity, and user independence. As a result, the final product is not only technically functional, but meaningfully inclusive.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This project also demonstrated the value of interdisciplinary collaboration, combining frontend design, backend logic, data architecture, and user experience design into a single cohesive system. The ability to iterate quickly and incorporate feedback helped the team remain agile, even as new needs and technical hurdles arose.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Looking ahead, the foundations laid by this project create space for exciting enhancements—such as expanded personalization, advanced environmental data, and enhanced security protocols. Just as important as the software produced is the insight gained: inclusive design is not a constraint, but a creative opportunity to make technology more effective, ethical, and empowering.</p>
